# VS Code

I use vscode on both the Mac and Windows. There are minor differences.

### config
symlink `settings.json` to:

- `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` on Linux
- `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json` on Windows
- `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` on WSL
- `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` on macOS
